# Tetris-in-WollokGame
A simple version of the classic game Tetris, made in Wollok Game.

### Things to work on:
- An algorithm to rotate pieces around a vortex on the board. Use off-sets.
- Change the actual falling algorithm to a better one, it's a little difficult to understand at once and it could be much simpler with some adjustments.
